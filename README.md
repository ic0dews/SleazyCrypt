# SleazyCrypt
Sleazy(Adjective):"marked by low character or quality"
SleazyCrypt is meant to be a runtime crypter written in C#, its incredibly straightforward and poorly made thus gaining its name sleazy. This project is meant to be a basic and simple C# crypter designed to illustrate how these low level crypters function.

## PLEASE NOTE
This is not finished, this crypter still developing and needs a lot of work. Right now it has a clean UI, but I still need to fix the crypting function and also allow the capability to add a stub.
